## C--Interpreter

This repository contains the code for an interpreter I wrote for the C-- Language, a subset of C, but with extra functionality such as functional arguments, return and composition.

### Instructions (Linux)

* Use command ```Lexer-Parser/./run.sh``` to run the interpreter on an example program 

* Use command ```Lexer-Parser/./test.sh``` to run the interpreter on the test suite
